Hi.

Building c3p0 should be as easy as editing build.properties and typing ant.

There is a dependency: You'll need an mchange-commons-java jar file, which is bundled
in the lib directory of c3p0's binary distribution as a convenience. 

Development snapshots and source for c3p0 are available on github as..

   https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0

Development snapshots and source for mchange-commons-java is also available on github...

   https://github.com/swaldman/mchange-commons-java

Please send any feedback / questions to Steve Waldman <swaldman@mchange.com>

All of the test related properties are very optional. There are various
test tasks in the build file, but they are ad-hoc and unsupported.
